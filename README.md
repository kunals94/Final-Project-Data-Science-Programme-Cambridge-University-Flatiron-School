## K. Sarin Final Project: Data Science Programme â€” Cambridge University & Flatiron School

<br>

**Dataset:** Airline Passenger Satisfaction was downloaded from Kaggle datasets: [Airline Passenger satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/airline-passenger-satisfaction). 

<br>

The dataset contains customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, and type of travel, as well as their evaluation of different factors like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.

<br>

<u>**Ambitions of this data exercise are to develop analysis on two topics:**</u><br>

<br>

**1. Analyse trends on flight usage by different demographics**
- *How does the class people travel in vary through different life stages?*
- *How does the types of flights and distances people generally travel to vary at different life stages?*

**2. From an airlines perspective, understand the key factors that drive satisfaction:**
- *What is the overall experience scores by different demographics?*
- *What are the key factors that drive dissatisfaction, and therefore where do airlines need to focus their attention?*
- *How do votes vary depending on cabin class for the key issues?*
