Kunal S - Customer airline trends and satisfaction analysis

Dataset: Airline Passenger Satisfaction was downloaded from Kaggle datasets: Airline Passenger satisfaction.

The dataset contains customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, and type of travel, as well as their evaluation of different factors like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience

Ambitions of this data exercise are to develop analysis on two topics:

Analyse trends on flight usage
What age groups typically take shorter / longer haul flights?
What patterns emerge when looking at the gender / age distribution of different flight types, distances?
From an airlines perspective, understand the key factors that drive satisfaction:
What is the overall experience scores by different customer types (age, gender)?
Amongst different cabin classes, how do scores differentiate?
What are the key factors that drive dissatisfaction, and therefore where do airlines need to focus their attention?
